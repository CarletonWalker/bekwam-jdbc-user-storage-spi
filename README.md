# Overview

Bekwam JDBC User Storage SPI project is a JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) extension for [Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org/).  The SPI allows Keycloak administrators to integrate one or more relational databases as additional authentication and authorization sources.  An SPI instance belongs to a Realm and a Realm can have multiple SPI instances.  The configuration of the SPI is performed though a User Federation screen.
